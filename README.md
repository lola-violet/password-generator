UWBC HW#3 - JavaScript Password Generator

## User Story

As a user, I want to generate a random password. 
When I click the button, I'm presented with a prompt and 4 confirm options to choose the length & character types of my password. 


## My failures

The code creates an array with the user's choices, but unfortunately I was unable to create the for loop that pulls a random character out of the array. I tried various methods for at least 3 hours, but I couldn't figure it out. 

I tried my hardest, and I will resubmit if necessary.
